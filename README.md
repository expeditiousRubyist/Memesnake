# Memesnake
Classic snake game. Snake is a string of characters, with food being the next character in the string. Once the snake is longer than the string, it will repeat itself. Words chan be set from the command line parameters, or the default of "MEMESNAKE" will be used. Using whitespace is not recommended, as this may make the game HARD.

# Compiling
Just run the make command. I have not tested with verions of Make other than GNU Make, so if you are on a BSD system, you may wish to use gmake.

# Dependencies
SFML 2.3.
